<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>The poems of this volume, gathered here after many requests, are, with a
few exceptions, from my previous lyrical publications. They are also in
a real sense an intimate record. For the sea has often enough seemed to
me almost as a vast external subconsciousness in which the forces of my
being&mdash;as well as the world's&mdash;were at play.</p>

<h2>SEA-HOARDINGS</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My heart is open again and sea flows in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shall fill with a summer of mists and winds and clouds and waves breaking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gull-wings over the green tide, of the surf's drenching din,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sudden horizon-sails that come and vanish, phantom-thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of arching sapphire skies, deep and unaching.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I shall lie on the rocks just over the weeds that drape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clear sea-pools, where birth and death in sunny ooze are teeming.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the crab in quest of booty sidles about, a sullen shape,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Where the snail creeps and the mussel sleeps with wary valves agape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where life is too grotesque to be but seeming.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the swallow shall weave my dreams with threads of flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shuttle with silver breast across the warp of the waves gliding;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And an isle far out shall be a beam in the loom of my delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pattern of every dream shall be a rapture bathed in light&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its evanescence a beauty most abiding.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the sunsets shall give sadness all its due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shall stain the sands and trouble the tides with all the ache of sorrow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shall bleed and die with a beauty of meaning old yet ever new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shall burn with all the hunger for things that hearts have failed to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shall whisper of a gold that none can borrow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the stars shall come and build a bridge of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the moon to cross the boundless sea, with never a fear of sinking.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They shall teach me of the magic things of life never to tire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how to renew, when it is low, the lamp of my desire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how to hope, in the darkest deeps of thinking.<br /></span>

<h2>THE SHORE'S SONG TO THE SEA</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Out on the rocks primeval,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grey Maine rocks that slant and break to the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the bay and juniper round them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the leagues on leagues before them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the terns and gulls wheeling and crying, wheeling and crying over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sat heart-still and listened.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And first I could only hear the wind in my ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the foam trying to fill the high rock-shallows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, over the wind, over the whitely blossoming foam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low, low, like a lover's song beginning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard the nuptial pleading of the old shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pleading ever occultly growing louder:&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>O sea, glad bride of me!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Born of the bright ether and given to wed me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Given to glance, ever, for me, and gleam and dance in the sun&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Come to my arms, come to my reaching arms,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That seem so still and unavailing to take you, and hold you,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Yet never forget,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Never by day or night,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The hymeneal delights of your embracings.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Come, for the moon, my rival, shall not have you;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No, for tho twice daily afar he beckons and you go,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>You, my bride, a little way back to meet him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As if he once had been your lover, he too, and again enspelled you,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Soon, soon, I know it is only feigning!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For turning, playfully turning, tidally turning,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>You rush foamingly, swiftly back to my arms!</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>And so would I have you rush; so rush now!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Come from the sands where you have stayed too long,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Come from the reefs where you have wandered silent,</i><br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For ebbings are good, the restful ebbings of love,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But, oh, the bridal flowings of it are better!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And now I would have you loose again my tresses,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My locks rough and weedy, rough and brown and brinily tangled,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0">No, no, my friend; there is an agony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to be exorcised out of the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By any voice of hope.&mdash;But, I will tell you.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The <i>Sonia</i> was sailing without lights&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing three hundred souls&mdash;and without bells;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she had reached the "Zone," where the Hun sharks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their torpedo tongues could spit death at us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the inky sea-hells where they hid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the main deck we stood, in a wind-shelter,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My wife, and by us a pale girl whose eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had all disaster in them. And my thought was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I hope to God the moon is shut so deep<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In cloud-murk there in the East that hurricanes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can't blow her out of it." For in the Zone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon had come to mean only betrayal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, if ever, was her wanton chance.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The slipping water soaked with soulless dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell under and around us shudderingly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet somehow brought an anxious hopefulness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We're making twenty knots," I said; and felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our bow cut thro the tangle of the waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the No Man's <i>Sea</i> ahead of us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would soon be crossed; and I, out to rejoin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My regiment, could set my wife safe somewhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And help again to stab that curst amphibian,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Autocracy&mdash;whose spawn in the sea gave it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A terror greater than infinitude's.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For God knows, with the woman that one loves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aboard a ship, and only a cloud perhaps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the Hun's shark eyes and sure escape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the black icy fathoms that would choke her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's little left within a man but nerves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So when I drew her closer into the shelter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the sheering wind, the life belt<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
<span class="i0">She wore seemed like a coffin in that sepulchre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of night and sea. And when the other, there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the disaster eyes and pallid face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned half toward us, I was shaken as if<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon had suddenly walked out of her shroud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With phosphorescent purpose to reveal us.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But on we plunged and tumbled, till at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blank monotonous sink and swell lulled me<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of her&mdash;my wife's&mdash;first kiss on a summer night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the moonlit laurels of our home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When came a cry from the wan girl gazing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frozenly on the sea&mdash;where the moon now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed was pointing at us pallidly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A death-path. And my throat was gripped by it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That clutching cry, as if the glacial depths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down under us already had risen up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So starting toward the slipping rail I called,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What is it? where?" For, tense as a clairvoyant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes that seemed to feel under the tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stealthy peril stalking us, she stood there.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>

<span class="i0">After a moment's gazing, I too saw&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What she foresensed&mdash;destruction seething toward us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The boats!" I cried, "the rafts!" And stumbled back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the streaming deck to her I loved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the shock came, as if the sea's wild heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had broken under us, and ripped the entrails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The human hundreds, out of our vessel's hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strew the foam with mania and despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shrieks strangled by wind and wave and terror.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where hands reached at the infinite then sank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where faces clung to wreckage as to eternity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sought for her who shared my life's voyage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had been my heart's pilot; and who now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrecked with me, swirled, too, in the torn waters....<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Against them as against God. And soon, somehow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had reached to a limp body on the surge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Limp and strange&mdash;but living ... and not drowned!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then seeing a raft near, I struggled onward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gulping the sea and being gulped by it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But finding arms at last that drew my burden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And me from horror to half-swooning safety.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I could have died, I think, of the relief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the moon came again, nakedly out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if to see what she had done. Then I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bending over the form that I had fought for,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chafing it, saw ... not her I loved!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Infinite Cruelty, not her I loved!...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that pale girl, with the eyes of all disaster.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, yes, I raved, and said God was a Hun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Kaiser of a Universe that loathed him.<br /></span>

Young Rice. They are all published by The Century Co., 353
Fourth Avenue, New York City.</h2>


<h2>SHADOWY THRESHOLDS</h2>

<h3>By CALE YOUNG RICE</h3>

<p>"Cale Young Rice is far too great a pout to be acclaimed in some
partisan circles.... He is intensely American ... as authentic an artist
as Shelley or Keats.... He has the magic of Poe without that poet's
morbidity.... He is America's living master-poet."&mdash;<i>D. F. Hannigan (The
Rochester Post-Express).</i></p>

<p>"This volume maintains Mr. Rice's usual high level and proves anew his
right to one of the high places among modern poets."&mdash;<i>Edward J. Wheeler
(Current Opinion).</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice is modern in the broadest sense of that term. Many of his
poems are without rhyme and have irregular metres, but they never offend
thereby.... His place in contemporary first class company is
secure.&mdash;<i>The Springfield Republican.</i></p>

<p>"A volume possessing range and variety, together with a lyric quality
which distinguishes this poet, who ranks among the foremost American
writers."&mdash;<i>The Post-Intelligencer (Seattle).</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice in his dramas is an enchanter, and to cast a spell is better
than to have uttered the most lovely lyrics&mdash;but he has done both."&mdash;<i>E.
A. Jonas (The Louisville Herald).</i></p>

<p>"A new volume showing again the power and beauty of Mr. Rice's
genius."&mdash;<i>The Boston Globe.</i></p>

<p>"What a pleasure to take up a new book by Cale Young Rice. Here we have
variety, if ever.... If one can only own one of his books this is a good
volume to choose."&mdash;<i>The Galveston News.</i></p>

<p>"Cale Young Rice is a poet capable of sounding the deep imaginative
strain not only with melody, but with vigor and power of thought. This
volume will add another shining stone to his reputation."&mdash;<i>The San
Francisco Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"Once more a book of the same high order as all Mr. Rice's work."&mdash;<i>The
Rochester Democrat-Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"Shadowy Thresholds has as great a variety of poetic forms as any volume
of late years.... Mr. Rice illumines many phases of life, uniting in his
work the finish and romance of the older poetry with the directness that
constitutes the best merit of the new."&mdash;<i>The Louisville Evening Post.</i></p>

<p><i>12mo. 179 pages. Price $1.50</i></p>


<h2>WRAITHS AND REALITIES</h2>

<h3>By CALE YOUNG RICE</h3>

<p>"In the writing of lyrics Mr. Rice is unequalled by any modern poet....
One must go outside of contemporary life to find anything of similar
excellence."&mdash;<i>Gordon Ray Young (The Los Angeles Times).</i></p>

<p>"A new book by Mr. Rice is always an event in American
letters...."&mdash;<i>The New York Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"Here, for all to read, is poetic genius spurred and wrought upon ... by
a rare and wondrous poetic inspiration.... It is like great chimes
sounding&mdash;jangled at times or overborne&mdash;but always great."&mdash;<i>The
Philadelphia North American.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice in his narratives can tell such tales as the old ballad-makers
would have gloated over, and can make them contemporary and convincing.
He can create life tragedies or comedies in a few lines and leave the
reader with a sense of having been given a full meal of circumstance....
He is original without striving to be so, and one can never be
embarrassed by the affirmation that he has come to hold a high place
among poets of America."&mdash;<i>The Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"Cale Young Rice has been credited with some of the finest poetry, and
regarded as a distinguished master of lyric utterance, and this latest
volume is warrant for such approval."&mdash;<i>The Brooklyn Eagle.</i></p>

<p>"We find in Mr. Rice the large and elemental vision a poet must have to
serve his people when overwhelmed by elemental sorrows and passions. His
poetry is a spiritual force interpreting life in the various phases of
intellect and emotion, with a beauty of finish and sense of form that
are unerring."&mdash;<i>The Louisville Post.</i></p>

<p>"All that has been said of Cale Young Rice, and that is much indeed, is
justified in this latest volume."&mdash;<i>The San Francisco Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"Cale Young Rice is a real poet of genuine and sincere inspiration,
never reminiscent or imitative or obvious, but singing from a full heart
his keen, meditative songs."&mdash;<i>The New York Times.</i></p>

<p><i>12mo. 187 pages. Price $1.50</i></p>


<h2>COLLECTED PLAYS AND POEMS</h2>

<h3>By CALE YOUNG RICE</h3>

<p>"The great quality of Cale Young Rice's work is that, amid all
distractions and changes in contemporary taste, it remains true to the
central drift of great poetry. His interests are very wide ... and his
books open up a most varied world of emotion and romance."&mdash;<i>Gilbert
Murray.</i></p>

<p>"The quality of Mr. Rice's work is high. It is seen at its best in his
poetic dramas, which maintain an astonishing elevation and intensity of
passion ... but his visionary and philosophical poems are nearly as
fine. He has a thorough mastery of form, yet notwithstanding the ease of
his verse it is never slipshod or mechanical."&mdash;<i>The Spectator
(London).</i></p>

<p>"With variations of phrase Cale Young Rice has been described by critics
here and in America as "the most distinguished master of lyric utterance
in the New World." ... He has dramatic genius ... and is a born maker of
songs.... His later volumes confirm the judgment of those who have named
him the first and most distinctive of modern American lyrists, and one
of the world's true poets."&mdash;<i>F. Heath (The London Bookman).</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice is an American poet whose reputation is deserved.... He has
achieved a high position as poet and dramatist, a great fertility and
variety of outlook being marked features of his work."&mdash;<i>The London
Times.</i></p>

<p>"Foremost among writers who have brought America into prominence in the
realm of modern thought is Mr. Cale Young Rice.... 'Collected Plays and
Poems' is one of the best offerings of verse we have had for long.
Indeed, it has real brilliance.... Mr. Rice's plays are
masterful."&mdash;<i>The Book Monthly (London).</i></p>

<p>"Cale Young Rice is highly esteemed by readers wherever English is the
native speech."&mdash;<i>The Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<p>"In Mr. Rice we have a voice such as America has rarely known
before."&mdash;<i>The Rochester (N. Y.) Post-Express.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice of today is the poet who sang to us yesterday of the big,
vital things of life.... With real genius he brings to the soul a sense
of things many of us have but dimly sensed in all our years."&mdash;<i>The
Philadelphia Record.</i></p>

<p>"These volumes are an anthology wrought by a master hand and endowed
with perennial vitality.... This writer is the most distinguished master
of lyric utterance in the new world ... and he has contributed much to
the scanty stock of American literary fame. Fashions in poetry come and
go, and minor lights twinkle fitfully as they pass in tumultuous review.
But these volumes are of the things that are eternal in poetic
expression.... They embody the hopes and impulses of universal
humanity."&mdash;<i>The Philadelphia North-American.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice has been hailed by too many critics as the poet of his
country, if not of his generation, not to create a demand for a full
edition of his works."&mdash;<i>The Hartford (Conn.) Courant.</i></p>

<p>"This gathering of his forces stamps Mr. Rice as one of the world's true
poets, remarkable alike for strength, versatility and beauty of
expression."&mdash;<i>The Chicago Herald (Ethel M. Colton).</i></p>

<p>"It is with no undue repetition that we speak of the very great range
and very great variety of Mr. Rice's subject, inspiration, and mode of
expression.... The passage of his spirit is truly from deep to
deep."&mdash;<i>Margaret S. Anderson (The Louisville Evening Post).</i></p>

<p>"It is good to find such sincere and beautiful work as is in these two
volumes.... Here is a writer with no wish to purchase fame at the price
of eccentricity of either form or subject."&mdash;<i>The Independent.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's style is that of the masters.... Yet it is one that is
distinctively American.... He will live with our great
poets."&mdash;<i>Louisville Herald (J. J. Cole).</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice is an American by birth, but he is not merely an American
poet. Over existence and the whole world his vision extends. He is a
poet of human life and his range is uncircumscribed."&mdash;<i>The Baltimore
Evening News.</i></p>

<p>"Viewing Mr. Rice's plays as a whole, I should say that his prime virtue
is fecundity or affluence, the power to conceive and combine events
resourcefully, and an abundance of pointed phrases which recalls and
half restores the great Elisabethans. His aptitude for structure is
great."&mdash;<i>The Nation (O. W. Firkins).</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice has fairly won his singing robes and has a right to be ranked
with the first of living poets. One must read the volumes to get an idea
of their cosmopolitan breadth and fresh abiding charm.... The dramas,
taken as a whole, represent the most important work of the kind that has
been done by any living writer.... This work belongs to that great world
where the mightiest spiritual and intellectual forces are forever
contending; to that deeper life which calls for the rarest gifts of
poetic expression."&mdash;<i>The Book News Monthly (Albert S. Henry).</i></p>

<h2>The following volumes are now included in the author's
"Collected Plays and Poems," and are not obtainable
elsewhere:</h2>


<h4>At the World's Heart</h4>

<p>"This book justifies the more than transatlantic reputation of its
author."&mdash;<i>The Sheffield (England) Daily Telegraph.</i></p>


<h4>Porzia: A Play</h4>

<p>"It matters little that we hesitate between ranking Mr. Rice highest as
dramatist or lyrist; what matters is that he has the faculty divine
beyond any living poet of America; his inspiration is true, and his
poetry is the real thing."&mdash;<i>The London Bookman.</i></p>


<h4>Far Quests</h4>

<p>"It shows a wide range of thought and sympathy, and real skill in
workmanship, while occasionally it rises to heights of simplicity and
truth, that suggest such inspiration as should mean lasting fame."&mdash;<i>The
Daily Telegraph (London).</i></p>


<h4>The Immortal Lure: Four Plays</h4>

<p>"It is great art&mdash;with great vitality."&mdash;<i>James Lane Allen.</i></p>

<p>"Different from Paola and Francesca, but excelling it&mdash;or any of Stephen
Phillips's work&mdash;in a vivid presentment of a supreme moment in the lives
of the characters."&mdash;<i>The New York Times.</i></p>


<h4>Many Gods</h4>

<p>"These poems are flashingly, glowingly full of the East.... What I am
sure of in Mr. Rice is that here we have an American poet whom we may
claim as ours."&mdash;<i>William Dean Howells, in The North American Review.</i></p>


<h4>Nirvana Days</h4>

<p>"Mr. Rice has the technical cunning that makes up almost the entire
equipment of many poets nowadays, but human nature is more to him always
... and he has the feeling and imaginative sympathy without which all
poetry is but an empty and vain thing."&mdash;<i>The London Bookman.</i></p>


<h4>A Night in Avignon: A Play</h4>

<p>"It is as vivid as a page from Browning. Mr. Rice has the dramatic
pulse."&mdash;<i>James Huneker.</i></p>


<h4>Yolanda of Cyprus: A Play</h4>

<p>"It has real life and drama, not merely beautiful words, and so differs
from the great mass of poetic plays."&mdash;<i>Prof. Gilbert Murray.</i></p>


<h4>David: A Play</h4>

<p>"It is safe to say that were Mr. Rice an Englishman or a Frenchman, his
reputation as his country's most distinguished poetic dramatist would
have been assured by a more universal sign of recognition."&mdash;<i>The
Baltimore News.</i></p>


<h4>Charles Di Tocca: A Play</h4>

<p>"It is the most powerful, vital, and truly tragical drama written by an
American for some years. There is genuine pathos, mighty yet never
repellent passion, great sincerity and penetration, and great elevation
and beauty of language."&mdash;<i>The Chicago Post.</i></p>


<h4>Song-Surf</h4>

<p>"Mr. Rice's work betrays wide sympathies with nature and life, and a
welcome originality of sentiment and metrical harmony."&mdash;<i>Sydney Lee.</i></p>


<h2>TRAILS SUNWARD</h2>

<h3>By CALE YOUNG RICE</h3>

<p>"Cale Young Rice has written some of the finest poetry of the last
decade, and is the author of the very best poetic dramas ever written by
an American.... He is one of the few supreme lyrists ... and one of the
few remaining lovers of beauty ... who write it. One of the very few
writers of <i>vers libre</i> who know just what they are doing."&mdash;<i>The Los
Angles Times.</i></p>

<p>"Another book by Cale Young Rice ... one of the few poetic geniuses this
country has produced.... In its sixty or more poems may be found the
hall mark of individuality that denotes preeminence and signalizes
independence."&mdash;<i>The Philadelphia North American.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice attempts and succeeds in deepening the note of his singing ...
keeping its brilliant technique, its intricate verse formation, but
seeking all the while for words to interpret the profound things of
life. The music of his lines is more perfect than ever, his rhythms
fresh and varied."&mdash;<i>Littell's Living Age.</i></p>

<p>"Cale Young Rice's work is always simple and sincere ... but that does
not prevent him from voicing his song with passion and virility. Nearly
all his poems have elevation of thought and feeling, with beauty of
imagery and music."&mdash;<i>The New York Times.</i></p>

<p>"Whether the forms of this book are lyrical, narrative, or dramatic,
there is an excellence of workmanship that denotes the master hand....
And while the range of ideas is broad, the treatment of each is
distinguished by a strength and beauty remarkably fine."&mdash;<i>The Continent
(Chicago).</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice proves the fine argument of his preface ... for this book has
in it form and beauty and a full reflection of the externals as well as
the soul of the America he loves."&mdash;<i>The Philadelphia Public Ledger.</i></p>

<p>"The work of this poet always demands and receives unstinted
admiration.... His is not the poetic fashion of the moment, but of all
poetic time."&mdash;<i>The Chicago Herald.</i></p>

<p>"In 'Trails Sunward,' Mr. Rice demonstrates as heretofore the
possibility of attaining poetic growth and originality even in the
Twentieth Century, without extremism.... Sanity linked with vitality and
breadth in art make for permanence, and one can but feel that Mr. Rice
builds for more than a day."&mdash;<i>The Louisville Courier Journal.</i></p>

<p>"I rarely use the term 'sublimity,' yet in touches of 'The Foreseers,'
particularly in its cavern-set opening, I should say that Mr. Rice had
scaled that eminence."&mdash;<i>O. W. Firkins (The Nation).</i></p>

<p><i>12mo. 150 pages. Price $1.50</i></p>


<h2>EARTH AND NEW EARTH</h2>

<h3>By CALE YOUNG RICE</h3>

<p>"America has today no poet who answers so well the multiplex tests of
poetry as does Cale Young Rice."&mdash;<i>New York Sun.</i></p>

<p>"Glancing through the reviews quoted at the end of 'Earth and New Earth'
we note that we have said some very enthusiastic things in praise of the
poetry of Cale Young Rice, and yet there is not an adjective we would
withdraw. On the contrary each new volume only confirms the expectation
of the better work this writer was to produce."&mdash;<i>The San Francisco
Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"This is a volume of verse rich in dramatic quality and beauty of
conception.... Every poem is quotable and the collection must appeal to
all who can appreciate the highest forms of modern verse."&mdash;<i>The
Bookseller (New York).</i></p>

<p>"Any one familiar with 'Cloister Lays,' 'The Mystic,' etc., does not
need to be told that they rank with the very best poetry. And Mr. Rice's
dramas are not equaled by any other American author's.... And when those
who are loyal to poetic traditions cherished through the whole history
of our language contemplate the anemia and artificiality of
contemporaries, they can but assert that Mr. Rice has the grasp and
sweep, the rhythm, imagery and pulsating sympathy, which in wondering
admiration are ascribed to genius."&mdash;<i>The Los Angeles Times.</i></p>

<p>"This latest collection shows no diminution in Mr. Rice's versatility or
power of expression. Its poems are serious, keen, distinctively free and
vitally spiritual in thought."&mdash;<i>The Continent (Chicago).</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice is concerned with thoughts that are more than timely; they
represent a large vision of the world events now transpiring ... and his
affirmation of the spiritual in such an hour establishes him in the
immemorial office of the poet-prophet.... The volume is a worthy
addition to the large amount of his work."&mdash;<i>Anna L. Hopper in The
Louisville Courier-Journal.</i></p>

<p>"Cale Young Rice is the greatest living American poet."&mdash;<i>D. F.
Hannigan, Lit. Ed. The Rochester Post-Express.</i></p>

<p>"The indefinable spirit of swift imaginative suggestion is never
lacking. The problems of fate are still big with mystery and propounded
with tense elemental dramatism."&mdash;<i>The Philadelphia North-American.</i></p>

<p>"The work of Cale Young Rice emerges clearly as the most distinguished
offering of this country to the combined arts of poetry and the drama.
'Earth and New Earth' strikes a ringing new note of the earth which
shall be after the War."&mdash;<i>The Memphis Commercial-Appeal.</i></p>

<p><i>12mo. 158 pages. $1.50</i></p>


<h2>TURN ABOUT TALES</h2>

<h3>(PROSE)</h3>

<h4>By CALE YOUNG RICE and ALICE HEGAN RICE</h4>

<p>"This volume of stories should hold its own with any collection likely
to be published this year."&mdash;<i>New York Post (The Literary Review).</i></p>

<p>"American writers have been distinctive as narrators of the short story,
but few, if any, volumes of such stories have recently been published in
this country equal to 'Turn About Tales.'"&mdash;<i>D. F. Hannigan (The
Rochester Post-Express).</i></p>

<p>"The gamut of the volume runs from spiritualism to the depths. It
contains something of almost anything one happens to want. Better yet,
it contains something new."&mdash;<i>The Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice has written well&mdash;so well as to justify prediction that he
will, if he elect to do so, achieve greater distinction as a short story
writer than as a poet. His 'Lowry,' 'Francella' and 'Aaron Harwood,' to
cite a few of the stories, meet the test of artistic stories.... Each
leaves an impression that will impel re-reading."&mdash;<i>Galveston News.</i></p>

<p>"Both writers portray, in their best vein, a consummate though
distinctive skill in analyzing and delineating human emotions and
experience."&mdash;<i>Buffalo Commercial.</i></p>

<p>"Those who have read Mr. Rice's poetry will find his dramatic genius
manifest in these stories."&mdash;<i>The Watchman, N. Y.</i></p>

<p>"Mrs. Rice's humor and pathos combine well with Mr. Rice's mastery of
diction and deep human understanding."&mdash;<i>Milwaukee Journal.</i></p>

<p>"Each story is notable for beauty of technique ... each has its definite
appeal."&mdash;<i>Louisville Evening Post (Margaret S. Anderson).</i></p>

<p>"Each of the stories is of such finished workmanship as to make reading
of it an unadulterated pleasure."&mdash;<i>Baltimore Sun.</i></p>

<p>"The book is one of the best of the kind in this year's American
fiction."&mdash;<i>The Spectator (Portland, Ore.)</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice has grappled with the constructive problems of his time, so
one finds them without surprise in this newly adopted vehicle.... Three
of his stories have a realism as relentless as Chekov's ... and it goes
without saying that his stories are technically admirable."&mdash;<i>Louisville
Courier-Journal.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice so lives through his characters that, as Whitman says, he 'Is
that man' of whom he writes."&mdash;<i>Pittsburg Sun.</i></p>

<p>"The same dramatic power and beauty that mark Mr. Rice's lyrics will be
found in these prose stories."&mdash;<i>Cincinnati Times-Star.</i></p>

<p>"One seldom finds a book of short stories so satisfying
throughout."&mdash;<i>Minneapolis Journal.</i></p>

<p><i>Price $1.90</i></p>
